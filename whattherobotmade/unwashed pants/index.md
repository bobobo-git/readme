  
(Verse 1)  
In a corner of my room, a pile of underpants unwashed  
Neglected and forgotten, by routines that clashed  
They lay there in disarray, a scent of tales untold  
Unraveling stories of adventures, yet to be behold  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, underpants unwashed, remnants of my days  
Holding secrets and memories, in their tangled ways  
They speak of lazy mornings, and nights of wild delight  
Underpants unwashed, witnesses to life's chaotic flight  
  
(Verse 2)  
Each pair has a story, a chapter of its own  
From the mundane to the extraordinary, a collection unknown  
Some bear the marks of laughter, from moments pure and sweet  
While others hold the stains of tears, when life seemed incomplete  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, underpants unwashed, remnants of my days  
Holding secrets and memories, in their tangled ways  
They speak of lazy mornings, and nights of wild delight  
Underpants unwashed, witnesses to life's chaotic flight  
  
(Bridge)  
They've traveled with me far and wide, through every twist and bend  
Through joy and sorrow, they've been a constant friend  
They've seen me at my best, and in moments of despair  
Underpants unwashed, a testament to moments we all share  
  
(Verse 3)  
So let's celebrate these underpants, neglected but not ignored  
For within their humble fibers, a life's journey is stored  
They remind me of the human touch, the messiness we embrace  
Underpants unwashed, a testament to life's unique grace  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, underpants unwashed, remnants of my days  
Holding secrets and memories, in their tangled ways  
They speak of lazy mornings, and nights of wild delight  
Underpants unwashed, witnesses to life's chaotic flight  
  
(Outro)  
So here's to the underpants, unwashed and unashamed  
Symbols of our humanity, where stories are proclaimed  
May we cherish every moment, in all its glorious mess  
Underpants unwashed, a testament to life's ongoing process
