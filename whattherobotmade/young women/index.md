(Verse 1)  
I see young women working hard, with dreams held in their eyes  
They're breaking down the barriers, reaching for the skies  
Through sweat and determination, they strive to make a change  
With every step they take, their strength they will arrange  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, young women, working hard and true  
With passion in their hearts, there's nothing they can't do  
They're breaking through the boundaries, rewriting history  
Oh, young women, empowering you and me  
  
(Verse 2)  
From dawn till dusk, they labor with unwavering grace  
In fields of knowledge, they leave an indelible trace  
They shatter glass ceilings, and pave their own way  
Their spirit shines like diamonds, brightening each day  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, young women, working hard and true  
With passion in their hearts, there's nothing they can't do  
They're breaking through the boundaries, rewriting history  
Oh, young women, empowering you and me  
  
(Bridge)  
In their ambition, they inspire us all  
Their voices rise, like a clarion call  
They fight for equality, and strive for their rights  
With every step they take, they shine a guiding light  
  
(Verse 3)  
With minds filled with knowledge, and hearts full of fire  
They're creating a future, where dreams never expire  
Through challenges they rise, embracing every test  
Young women working hard, they're among the very best  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, young women, working hard and true  
With passion in their hearts, there's nothing they can't do  
They're breaking through the boundaries, rewriting history  
Oh, young women, empowering you and me  
  
(Outro)  
So let's stand beside them, support them on their way  
Cheer for their achievements, each and every day  
For in their perseverance, a world of change unfolds  
Young women working hard, their stories to be told
