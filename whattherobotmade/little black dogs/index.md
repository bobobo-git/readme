(Verse 1)  
I saw little black dogs running, beneath the silver moon  
Their paws were swift and graceful, like a sweet and playful tune  
With fur as dark as midnight, they danced across the night  
Bringing joy and laughter, with every tail-wagging sight  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, little black dogs, with hearts so full of glee  
In their playful antics, a happiness set free  
With their loyal spirits, they brighten up our days  
Oh, little black dogs, in their own special ways  
  
(Verse 2)  
Through fields and meadows, they frolic and they chase  
Their joy infectious, a smile upon each face  
With wagging tails and eager eyes, they greet us with delight  
Little black dogs, in their presence, everything feels right  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, little black dogs, with hearts so full of glee  
In their playful antics, a happiness set free  
With their loyal spirits, they brighten up our days  
Oh, little black dogs, in their own special ways  
  
(Bridge)  
They teach us about love, in its purest form  
Their devotion unwavering, through calm or storm  
In their presence, we find solace, a friend who's always near  
Little black dogs, their love is crystal clear  
  
(Verse 3)  
So let's cherish these companions, who bring us endless cheer  
Their loyalty and friendship, precious treasures held so dear  
With their wagging tails and gentle eyes, they touch our very souls  
Little black dogs, their love makes us whole  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, little black dogs, with hearts so full of glee  
In their playful antics, a happiness set free  
With their loyal spirits, they brighten up our days  
Oh, little black dogs, in their own special ways  
  
(Outro)  
So, as I sing this melody, in Dylan's timeless style  
I honor little black dogs, who make our lives worthwhile  
In their unconditional love, may we always find delight  
Little black dogs, shining stars in the darkest night
