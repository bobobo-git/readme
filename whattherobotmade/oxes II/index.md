(Verse 1)  
Well, I woke up this morning, with the oxes by my side  
Their gentle eyes a-glowing, as we faced the countryside  
Their steady breath, a rhythm, like a heartbeat in the air  
I found my inspiration, in the oxes' solemn stare  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the oxen they are plowin', toiling in the field  
Their strength and their devotion, a testament revealed  
With patience and endurance, they bear the burdens we all share  
In their quiet strength, I find solace, in the oxes' solemn stare  
  
(Verse 2)  
As the sun begins to rise, casting golden hues of light  
The oxen start their journey, from the early morning's night  
Their hooves upon the earth, a symphony of ancient lore  
In their humble presence, I find wisdom, in the oxes' solemn stare  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the oxen they are plowin', toiling in the field  
Their strength and their devotion, a testament revealed  
With patience and endurance, they bear the burdens we all share  
In their quiet strength, I find solace, in the oxes' solemn stare  
  
(Bridge)  
Through valleys and through mountains, they navigate with grace  
Their gentle souls, unwavering, in every step they trace  
They teach me of resilience, and the power to endure  
In the oxen's quiet dignity, I find my own allure  
  
(Verse 3)  
So let me walk beside them, in the fields of endless green  
With the oxes as my companions, a harmony serene  
In their steadfast presence, I find solace from life's wear and tear  
In their timeless gaze, I find peace, in the oxes' solemn stare  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the oxen they are plowin', toiling in the field  
Their strength and their devotion, a testament revealed  
With patience and endurance, they bear the burdens we all share  
In their quiet strength, I find solace, in the oxes' solemn stare  
  
(Outro)  
So, as I sing this song, in the style of Dylan's grace  
I pay homage to the oxen, their spirit I embrace  
In their silent wisdom, I find solace everywhere  
In the echoes of their presence, in the oxes' solemn stare
