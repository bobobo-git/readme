  
(Verse 1)  
I saw a sparrow on a wire, singing a sweet refrain  
Its melody so gentle, like drops of summer rain  
With feathers painted brown, it soared into the sky  
A tiny creature with a voice that reached so high  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, little sparrow, sing your song up high  
Through the trials and the sorrows, let your spirit fly  
In your humble beauty, a lesson to us all  
Oh, little sparrow, let your melody enthrall  
  
(Verse 2)  
In the early morning light, it greets the rising sun  
Its song a serenade, for everyone to come  
With grace and lightness, it dances through the air  
A symbol of resilience, a joy beyond compare  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, little sparrow, sing your song up high  
Through the trials and the sorrows, let your spirit fly  
In your humble beauty, a lesson to us all  
Oh, little sparrow, let your melody enthrall  
  
(Bridge)  
Through storms and tempests, it weathers every blow  
Finding strength within, as the winds of change may blow  
In its fragile frame, a spirit that's unbound  
A testament to courage, in every chirping sound  
  
(Verse 3)  
So let us learn from sparrows, in their simplicity  
To find joy in the little things, and set our spirits free  
In their humble presence, we find solace in the day  
A reminder of the beauty that's found along the way  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, little sparrow, sing your song up high  
Through the trials and the sorrows, let your spirit fly  
In your humble beauty, a lesson to us all  
Oh, little sparrow, let your melody enthrall  
  
(Outro)  
So, as I sing this tune, in Dylan's timeless style  
I pay homage to the sparrows, who make our lives worthwhile  
In their joyful melodies, may we find our own release  
And let our spirits soar, like sparrows in perfect peace
