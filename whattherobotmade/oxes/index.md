(Verse 1)  
Mama, take this plow from my hands  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to till  
I feel I'm knockin' on the oxes' door  
  
(Chorus)  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
(Verse 2)  
Mama, put my saddle on the ground  
I can't ride 'em anymore  
That old trail, it's getting long  
I feel I'm knockin' on the oxes' door  
  
(Chorus)  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
(Bridge)  
Oxen carry the burden, strong and true  
Pullin' wagons, workin' through and through  
But when they're tired and their journey's done  
They'll rest in fields under the setting sun  
  
(Verse 3)  
Mama, take this yoke off my neck  
I can't bear it anymore  
The load is heavy, my spirit's weak  
I feel I'm knockin' on the oxes' door  
  
(Chorus)  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
(Outro)  
Mama, I hear hoofbeats in the distance  
They're calling me, forevermore  
As I walk this farm, one last time  
I'll keep knockin' on the oxes' door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah  
Knock, knock, knockin' on the oxes' door  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
